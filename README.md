# Url-Shortener
This project was built with Node.js, React.js and MongoDB.
Make sure to run npm install so as to install dependencies then npm start

This project was intended to shorten urls such as links to profile information with long urls. The website should therefore have a form to paste the long url and once converted the output should have two parts. The first part is the url shortener website's domain name and the second part is a unique code with a length of six characters.
I was able to build the website using React for front-end and NodeJs with MongoDB at the back-end. The back-end receives a get request and renders the interface on the browser. It also has a post router and a redirect router. Once the Long URL is posted to the back-end, it is converted and the shorter URL is returned as response. The User can therefore use the shorter URL however he/she wishes to be redirected to the original shortened URL.

Therefore, the project works efficiently since the short URLS are redirected quickly and precisely.
